        <h2>what is User Story?</h2>
        <p id="tribute-info">In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system. They are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or in project management software. Depending on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders including clients, users, managers or development team members.</p>
      <p>User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking and communication; that is, they help software teams organize their understanding of the system and its context.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>In 1998 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_Cockburn">Alistair Cockburn</a> visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In 2001,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Jeffries"> Ron Jeffries</a> proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul id="threeCs">
        <li>The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible durable physical token to hold the concepts         </li>
        <li>The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation;</li>
        <li>The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <p>In 2004, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Cohn"> Mike Cohn</a> generalises the user story principles beyond the usage of cards in a book[5] that is now considered as the reference standard for the topic according to Martin Fowler.</p>
